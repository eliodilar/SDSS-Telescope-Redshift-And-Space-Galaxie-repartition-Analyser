# SDSS-Telescope-Redshift-And-Space-Galaxie-repartition-Analyser
Hello, this is a small software who i have realise to analyse ra_dec_z_r_v_lumdistok.csv data from SDSS telescope 2.5meters ( to finish)

Link to download the SDSS catalogue.CSV 

My official WebSite:
http://www.jerome-chapoul.com/

Profil WebPage -> téléchargement -> SDSSData File.
File: maingalaxyfulldata.csv 100 Mo. 620 000 galaxy.


Software utilisation:
Software is use to analyse redshift decalage of 620 000 Galaxy form SDSS telescope New Mexico.
You can see RVB,X,Gamma color, chromatic, spiderlink variation from the different celestical object and also analyse repartition of galaxie in a 2 dimesnsion or 3dimension cartesian plan.

Cluster selector is use to make a proportional variation of Celestical objects.
Lumdist is use to generate a 2D/3D plan for galaxy repartition analyse -0%=2D  ->1%=3D -> exponential function selector.
You can select data to analyse to the right by cursor selection ( exemple chromatic, redshift...)( some function are not finishes.
When you load .csv, the soft make a first analyse to generate Min and Max value for all parameters URZIG...
The data can be watch on the front of the application, after you need just to put your data ( tha data what you want to analyse in the to case under data front print.( exemple: 0.2 -0.4).

be cool with soft, it was an old project and 620 000*12 data of 32/64 bits is long to charge^^ 15 seconds.

Enjoy.
If some developper want to finish it, no problems.
You can have a place as contributors.
